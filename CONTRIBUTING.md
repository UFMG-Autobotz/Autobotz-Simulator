# Improving the Autobotz Simulator

If the resources already available are not enough for your application or if you are beginning a new project, you can add new files to improve the Autobotz Simulator. To do so, please follow the instructions presented here.

## Choosing the directory

The name of the subdirectories should give you a hint of its content, but, if it's not clear for you where to save your work, see the `README.md` of each subdirectory.

## Name conventions

The name convention for files or directories which contain simulation elements is `UPPERCASEPROJECT_snake_case_name`, followed by the appropriate extension for files.

## More information

Most subdirectories have a `README.md` and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` files. Please read them before contributing to a subdirectory.
